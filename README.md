# React Simple Multi-Page Application

This project is a simple multi-page web application built with React. It includes four main pages: **Home**, **Menu**, **About**, and **Contact**. The navigation between pages is handled using React Router DOM, and icons are integrated with React Icons. Styling is implemented via `index.css`.
